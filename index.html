                Cascading Stylesheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should
                start learning after HTML. While HTML is used to define the structure
                and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out.
                For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and
                spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
                animations and other decorative features.
            </p>

            <p>
                You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We
                recommend that you work through our Introduction to HTML module first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you
                learn further HTML and CSS at the same time, moving back and forth
                between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting
                and much more fun to learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really
                learn CSS without knowing HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using
                computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it,
                consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set
                up as detailed in Installing basic software and understand how to
                create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both of
                which are parts of our Getting started with the web complete
                beginner's module.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the
                web before proceeding with this topic, especially if you are
                completely new to web development. However, much of what is covered in
                its CSS basics article is also covered in our CSS first steps module,
                albeit in a lot more detail.

                The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
                we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
                ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
                way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as
                <code>styles.css</code>. The <code>.css</code> extension shows that
                this is a CSS file.
            </p>
            <p>
                To link <code>styles.css</code> to <code>index.html</code> add the
                following line somewhere inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the
                HTML document:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
                This <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element tells the browser that we have
                a stylesheet, using the <code>rel</code> attribute, and the location
                of that stylesheet as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.

                This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for
                working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
            </p>
            <h4>CSS first steps</h4>
            <p class="module-text">
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages —
                for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
                content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
                path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
                syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
                HTML.
            </p>
            <h4>CSS building blocks</h4>
            <p class="module-text">
                This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
                gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
                basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This
                module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
                have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
                debugging, and lots more.
            </p>
            <p class="module-text">
                The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent
                CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on
                to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.
            </p>
            <h4>Styling text</h4>
            <p class="module-text">
                With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for
                you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things
                you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
                including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing,
                drop shadows and other text features. We round off the module by
                looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and
                links.
            </p>
            <h4>CSS layout</h4>
            <p class="module-text">
                At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
                text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
                inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
                place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered
                the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
                looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like
                flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques
                you might still want to know about.

                The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled
                using CSS. The CSS properties that I have used are as follows — each
                one links to its property page on MDN, which will give you more
                examples of its use.
